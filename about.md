Hello!

My name is Elias and welcome to my blog, here I will write about random progamming projects that I do in my spare time. The idea is that this blog will serve as a complement to my [Github profile](https://github.com/eliasrhoden), where I can focus more on the backstory behing the projects I upload.

My general interests are:
	* Programming
	* Industrial Automation
	* Control theory/Control systems
	* Optimization


If you wanna check out my academic brackground, I would refer to my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/elias-rhoden-265609224).
